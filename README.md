# TowActivities


Overview:

-   An  `Activity`  is an app component that provides a single screen focused on a single user task.
-   Each  `Activity`  has its own user interface layout file.
-   You can assign your  `Activity`  implementations a parent/child relationship to enable Up navigation within your app.
-   A  `View`  can be made visible or invisible with the  `android:visibility`  attribute.

To implement an  `Activity:`

-   Choose  **File > New > Activity**  to start from a template and do the following steps automatically.
-   If not starting from a template, create an  `Activity`  Java class, implement a basic UI for the  `Activity`  in an associated XML layout file, and declare the new  `Activity`  in AndroidManifest.xml.

`Intent`:

-   An  `Intent`  lets you request an action from another component in your app, for example, to start one  `Activity`  from another. An  `Intent`  can be explicit or implicit.
-   With an explicit  `Intent`  you indicate the specific target component to receive the data.
-   With an implicit  `Intent`  you specify the functionality you want but not the target component.
-   An  `Intent`  can include data on which to perform an action (as a URI) or additional information as  `Intent`  _extras_.
-   `Intent`  _extras_  are key/value pairs in a  `Bundle`  that are sent along with the  `Intent`
